<p class="ltx_p">Expensive sensors and inefficient algorithmic pipelines significantly affect the overall cost of autonomous machines. However, affordable robotic solutions are essential to practical usage, and their financial impact constitutes a fundamental requirement to employ service robotics in most fields of application. Among all, researchers in the precision agriculture domain strive to devise robust and cost-effective autonomous platforms in order to provide genuinely large-scale competitive solutions.
In this article, we present a complete algorithmic pipeline for row-based crops autonomous navigation, specifically designed to cope with low-range sensors and seasonal variations. Firstly, we build on a robust data-driven methodology to generate a viable path for the autonomous machine, covering the full extension of the crop with only the occupancy grid map information of the field. Moreover, our solution leverages on latest advancement of deep learning optimization techniques and synthetic generation of data to provide an affordable solution that efficiently tackles the well-known Global Navigation Satellite System unreliability and degradation due to vegetation growing inside rows. Extensive experimentation and simulations against computer-generated environments and real-world crops demonstrated the robustness and intrinsic generalizability to different factors of variations of our methodology that opens the possibility of highly affordable and fully autonomous machines.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Recently, deep learning methodologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="Deep learning" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> revolutionized the entire computer perception field, endowing machines with an unprecedented representation of the surrounding environment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="A survey of deep learning techniques for autonomous driving" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.

<p class="ltx_p">Firstly, we build on a robust data-driven methodology to generate a viable path for the autonomous machine, covering the full extension of the crop with only the occupancy grid map information of the field. Successively, depending on the vegetation growth status of the crop, we adopt a purely Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) local path planning or a vision-based algorithm that exclusively makes use of a low-cost RGB-D camera to navigate inside the inter-row space. Indeed, meteorological conditions and especially lush vegetation and thick canopies, significantly affect GNSS reliability, degrading its precision and consequently the overall navigation pipeline, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib37" title="Performance comparison of single and multi-gnss receivers under agricultural fields in korea" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="GPS-free localisation and navigation of an unmanned ground vehicle for yield forecasting in a vineyard" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>. Conversely, our vision-based system exploits semantic information of the environment to navigate between rows and depth information to refine the underline control smoothness, disentangling from the necessity of a precise localization. Moreover, we make exclusively usage of synthetic data and domain randomization, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="Domain randomization for transferring deep neural networks from simulation to the real world" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite>, to enable affordable supervised learning and simultaneously bridging the domain gap between simulation and reality.

<p class="ltx_p">In this state-of-the-art landscape, our team started in 2019 a research project with the precise aim to develop a complete working pipeline to autonomously navigate in vineyard rows without relying on multiple expensive sensors. As already introduced, computer vision and deep learning based algorithms, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="Deep learning" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, have demonstrated particular robustness in solving problems with noisy signals.

to detect the rows of the vineyards, DeepWay, a robust data-driven approach for global path generation, was presented. Besides being more robust and easier to adopt, DeepWay is a highly general approach that can be extended to every kind of row-based crops.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The proposed work is intended for presenting a complete autonomous navigation system for general row-based crops. The designed autonomous system is organized in several software modules that should collaborate with each other in order to obtain effective and reliable driverless navigation throughout the whole field. A visualization of the complete pipeline is shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ I-A Related Work ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Deep Learning Driven Algorithmic Pipeline for Autonomous Navigation in Row-Based Crops" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Firstly, the system takes as input a georeferenced occupancy grid map of the considered crop to compute a global path made of geographic coordinates; in particular, it exploits the DeepWay network, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="DeepWay: a deep learning waypoint estimator for global path generation" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>, to estimate the start/end waypoints of each row, then a custom global path planner, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib59" title="An adaptive row crops path generator with deep learning synergy" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, computes the desired path maintaining a safe distance from crops. Secondly, according to the season period and the amount of crop vegetation, it is possible to choose the kind of navigation to perform: only GNSS-based or GNSS and AI-assisted.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In case a good view of sky is available both outside and inside the row space, the system exploits only Real Time Kinematic (RTK) corrections, GNSS signals, and inertial data to autonomously guide the mobile platform throughout the crops. On the other hand, when lush vegetation is present, the proposed navigation system makes use of RTK corrections, GNSS signals, and inertial data to perform the row switch, since outside the row space a good sky view is available, while along the rows it exploits the camera, the deep neural network, and the segmentation-based control to overcome GNSS signals unreliability.
In both scenarios, the system strongly relies on estimated global positions of the UGV in order to follow the provided global path. In our approach, the localization problem is tackled fusing the positioning information coming from an RTK enabled GNSS receiver and the inertial data provided by an IMU. All the data is loosely fused exploiting the well-known Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), that uses an omnidirectional model for prediction and outputs position estimations in the form of: <math id="S2.p3.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="x,y,yaw" display="inline"><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>w</mi></mrow></mrow></math>, since the navigation happens in 2-dimension. <math id="S2.p3.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="x" display="inline"><mi>x</mi></math> and <math id="S2.p3.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="y" display="inline"><mi>y</mi></math> are global spatial information represented in the East-North-Up (ENU) reference frame, while <math id="S2.p3.m4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="yaw" display="inline"><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>w</mi></mrow></math> is the absolute orientation with respect to magnetic north, corrected with the actual magnetic declination.
Once the localization filter is set up, in case a clear view of the sky is available, the navigation algorithm uses the estimated UGV positions, the global path and a local planner based on the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) to autonomously guide the mobile platform; otherwise, it makes use of both GNSS-based and AI-assisted navigation, that exploit GNSS signals and semantic information of crops to safely navigate in the whole field without colliding with the crops.
In the latter case, the navigation type selection occurs comparing the estimated UGV global positions and an ordered waypoints list computed by the DeepWay neural network and successively refined. Finally, it is important to underline that DWA navigation scheme is only one possible solution. It is adopted in the presented pipeline for its simplicity, flexibility and online collision avoidance capability. However, further experimentation with even simpler algorithms has been performed but not presented for the sake of conciseness. For instance, the Pure Pursuit controller <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib60" title="Implementation of the pure pursuit path tracking algorithm" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> demonstrated very promising results between and outside rows, bringing possible advantages in presence of more packed rows or larger vehicles.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Among all recent real-time semantic segmentation models, we carefully select an architecture that guarantees high accuracy levels by also containing hardware costs, optimization simplicity, and computational load. Indeed, the segmentation-based control does not considerably benefit from fine grained predictions and elaborated encoder-decoder networks, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="Real-time semantic segmentation with fast attention" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, or two-pathway backbones, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="Bisenet v2: bilateral network with guided aggregation for real-time semantic segmentation" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, does not bring any considerable improvement. Therefore, we adopt a very lightweight backbone, MobileNetV3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib55" title="Searching for mobilenetv3" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, followed by a reduced
version of the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="Rethinking atrous convolution for semantic image segmentation" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, to capture richer contextual information with minimal computational impact. Indeed, the output of the last layer of the backbone can not be used directly to predict the segmentation mask due to the lack of spatial details.</p>

The backbone, with repeated spatial reductions, extracts contextual information and two of its branches at different resolution feed the segmentation head. One layer applies atrous convolution
to the 1/16 resolution to extract denser features, and the
other one is used to add a skip connection from the 1/4
resolution to work with more detailed information. Finally, in order to maintain real-time performance even without hardware accelerators, we employ a 224x224 low-resolution input. So, we rescale the global
average pooling layer setting the kernel size to 12×12 with
strides (4,5). Additionally, to have equal input and output
dimensions, we add a final bilinear upsampling with a factor of 8 at the end of the segmentation head.</p>

We perform such operation because, in an ideal segmentation mask there are no 1s at the top of the image and on the bottom, whilst the majority of them are supposed to be in the central belt.
After the noise reduction phase, we store the sum over columns of the obtained matrix <math id="S3.SS4.p3.m34" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\textbf{{X}}_{ctrl}^{t}" display="inline"><msubsup><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_bold-italic">X</mtext><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>l</mi></mrow><mi>t</mi></msubsup></math> in the array <math id="S3.SS4.p3.m35" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\textbf{{c}}\in\mathbb{R}^{w}" display="inline"><mrow><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_bold-italic">c</mtext><mo>∈</mo><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mi>w</mi></msup></mrow></math>, that contains the amount of segmented trees for each column. Therefore, every zero in <span class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">c</span> is a potential empty space where to route the mobile platform.
Then, we select the clusters of zeros in <span class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">c</span>, which are the groups of consecutive zeros, in order to store them in the list <span class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">zeros</span>.
Next, we look for the largest cluster of zeros <span class="ltx_text ltx_markedasmath ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">max_cluster</span> and in case of the length of such cluster is over an empirically chosen threshold, <math id="S3.SS4.p3.m40" class="ltx_Math" alttext="anomaly\_th=0.8\cdot w" display="inline"><mrow><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>o</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">_</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>h</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>0.8</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em">⋅</mo><mi>w</mi></mrow></mrow></math>, the driving commands are set to zero value, because it means the provided cumulative segmentation mask <math id="S3.SS4.p3.m41" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\textbf{{X}}_{ctrl}^{t}" display="inline"><msubsup><mtext class="ltx_mathvariant_bold-italic">X</mtext><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>l</mi></mrow><mi>t</mi></msubsup></math> has more zeros than ones, that is an anomaly, so for safety reason the mobile platform is stopped. While, in case of no anomalies, we compute the cluster center that is given as input to the control function.
The identified cluster contains the obstacle-free space information that can be exploited to safely drive the mobile platform; as a consequence the linear and angular velocities are computed using the center of the selected cluster, which ideally corresponds to the center position of the row in front of the UGV. The desired velocities are obtained by means of two custom functions:</p>

<p class="ltx_p">As far as the two presented deep neural networks are concerned, they require to be trained on specific datasets according to the desired final application. Supervised learning training algorithms are the easiest to adopt with usually the best final results. However, they all require supervision by means of a labeled training dataset. That greatly affects costs and makes data collection complex and time-consuming. Therefore, we make exclusively use of synthetic data and domain randomization <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="Domain randomization for transferring deep neural networks from simulation to the real world" class="ltx_ref">46</a>]</cite> to enable affordable supervised learning and simultaneously bridge the domain gap between simulation and reality.</p>

The coordinates of starting and ending points of each row are generated by geometrical reasoning and the occupancy grid is obtained with circles of different radius for each location in between two corresponding points. Random holes in the rows are also created to increase the variability of the images. Ground truth waypoints are obtained to always lay inside the rows, since we experimentally found it helps the network prediction.

Then, exploiting Python language compatibility of Blender, we write a script able to automatically capture RGB images and the corresponding segmentation masks of the scene from different positions with respect to the central reference frame and with different illuminations conditions in order to obtain as much as possible a random and complete synthetic dataset. An example of a synthetic RGB image, along with the corresponding segmentation mask, is shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ IV-A Datasets creation ‣ IV Experimental Results and Discussions ‣ A Deep Learning Driven Algorithmic Pipeline for Autonomous Navigation in Row-Based Crops" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.

That total number of images in conjunction with transfer learning allows to train a segmentation network with high generalization capabilities while minimizing generation data costs.

<p class="ltx_p">Regarding the segmentation network, we train our model applying transfer learning to the selected backbone. Indeed, rather than using randomly initialized weights, we exploit MobileNetV3 variables derived from an initial training phase on the 1k classes and 1.3M
images of the ImageNet dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="Imagenet: a large-scale hierarchical image database" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Moreover, we pre-trained the overall segmentation network with Cityscapes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, a publicly available dataset with 30 different classes and 5000 fine annotated images. Finally, we adopt a strong data augmentation with random crops, brightness, saturation, contrast, rotation, and flips. All together, those techniques largely improve the final robustness of the model and its final generalization capability with a reduced number of training samples.
We train the network with stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.03 and Intersection over Unit (IoU) as loss function. The accuracy over the test set is 0.8 with a IoU of 0.46. In comparison, the accuracy of the validation set with 0.1 of the synthetic dataset is 0.86 with a domain gap of 0.08. Moreover, our experimentation shows that larger input sizes improve segmentation over the synthetic dataset, but greatly reduces accuracy over real images.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The trained network is optimized in order to reduce latency, inference cost, memory, and storage footprint. That is obtained with two distinct techniques: model
pruning and quantization. The first simplifies the topological structure, removing unnecessary parts of the architecture, and favors a more sparse model introducing
zeros to the parameter tensors. Subsequently, with
quantization, we reduce the precision of the numbers used
to represent model parameters from float32 to float16. That can be accomplished with a post-training quantization procedure.

<p class="ltx_p">As mobile platform, we select the Jackal UGV by Clearpath Robotics, which can be briefly described as a small and weatherproof rover (IP62 code) with a 4x4 high-torque drivetrain. It is highly customizable and ROS-compatible allowing fast deployment and algorithm testing.
All the algorithms run on Jackal’s onboard Mini-ITX PC with a CPU Intel Core i3-4330TE @2.4GHz and 4GB DDR3 RAM.

In addition, to get a front view of the environment, we select the Intel Realsense D455 RGBD camera, that provides frames at <math id="S4.SS3.p1.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="30" display="inline"><mn>30</mn></math> FPS and is mounted on the front part of Jackal’s top plate. Finally, the odometry is provided by the on-board quadrature encoders that are able to run at <math id="S4.SS3.p1.m4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="78000" display="inline"><mn>78000</mn></math> pulses/m.
As mentioned in Section <a href="#S2" title="II System Overview ‣ A Deep Learning Driven Algorithmic Pipeline for Autonomous Navigation in Row-Based Crops" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">II</span></a>, the IMU and GNSS receiver data are fused by means of an EKF in order to obtain a global position estimate of the mobile platform time by time, described in terms of <math id="S4.SS3.p1.m5" class="ltx_Math" alttext="x,y,yaw" display="inline"><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>w</mi></mrow></mrow></math>.

Moreover, all the tests have been performed with the same hardware and software setup to obtain consistent data. The vineyard is located in Grugliasco and managed by the Department of Agricultural, Forestry and Food Sciences of Università degli studi di Torino (UNITO). In contrast, the pear orchard is located in Montegrosso d’Asti and managed by Mura Mura farm.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We presented a novel affordable algorithmic pipeline for autonomous navigation in row-based crops. Our methodology is a complete solution that covers all navigation stages, from global to local path planning, only relying on low-cost, low-range sensors. Moreover, the system efficiently tackles GNSS unreliability in presence of lush vegetation and thick canopies, allowing the platform to autonomously navigate in all seasonal periods. Finally, the adopted domain generalization and optimization techniques greatly make training and inference of deep neural network less time and computational costly. Further works will aim at assessing our proposed algorithmic pipeline onto a more cumbersome vehicle and introducing a collision avoidance algorithm in the segmentation-based control.</p>
