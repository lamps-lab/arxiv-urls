\section{Conclusion}
In this early draft, we present a complete protocol for a physical card-based system for phased vaccine distribution, individual vaccination, second-dose adherence, and symptom follow-up. Due to their physical nature and simplicity, digitally-signed QR codes may be a convenient and non-intrusive modality for some users seeking vaccination. Digitally-signed QR stickers enable verification of authentically created immunization records, and the encryption schema presented using a unique passkey sticker ensures that user PII can only be decrypted with the user’s consent. This information is stored physically on the user’s SafePaths card in a decentralized manner wherein a user must provide their physical passkey sticker for decryption of PII. These cards also extend privacy-focused protocols to low-resource areas and populations, equalizing disparities in access to individual-centric solutions and frameworks for COVID-19 vaccination. The centralised health data collected (which is rid of all PIIs) can be used by the concerned authorities to have population aggregated view of the vaccine adherence in a region. Furthermore, such privacy preserving dashboards which show aggregated data can help the authorities take informed decisions.
