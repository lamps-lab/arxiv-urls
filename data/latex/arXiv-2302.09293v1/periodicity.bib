TITLE = {An Auto-Encoder with Genetic Algorithm for High Dimensional Data: Towards Accurate and Interpretable Outlier Detection},

ABSTRACT = {When dealing with high-dimensional data, such as in biometric, e-commerce, or industrial applications, it is extremely hard to capture the abnormalities in full space due to the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly complicated but essential to provide interpretations for outlier detection results in high-dimensional space as a consequence of the large number of features. To alleviate these issues, we propose a new model based on a Variational AutoEncoder and Genetic Algorithm (VAEGA) for detecting outliers in subspaces of high-dimensional data. The proposed model employs a neural network to create a probabilistic dimensionality reduction variational autoencoder (VAE) that applies its low-dimensional hidden space to characterize the high-dimensional inputs. Then, the hidden vector is sampled randomly from the hidden space to reconstruct the data so that it closely matches the input data. The reconstruction error is then computed to determine an outlier score, and samples exceeding the threshold are tentatively identified as outliers. In the second step, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used as a basis for examining and analyzing the abnormal subspace of the outlier set obtained by the VAE layer. After encoding the outlier dataset&rsquo;s subspaces, the degree of anomaly for the detected subspaces is calculated using the redefined fitness function. Finally, the abnormal subspace is calculated for the detected point by selecting the subspace with the highest degree of anomaly. The clustering of abnormal subspaces helps filter outliers that are mislabeled (false positives), and the VAE layer adjusts the network weights based on the false positives. When compared to other methods using five public datasets, the VAEGA outlier detection model results are highly interpretable and outperform or have competitive performance compared to current contemporary methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Traditional time-series clustering methods usually perform poorly on high-dimensional data. However, image clustering using deep learning methods can complete image annotation and searches in large image databases well. Therefore, this study aimed to propose a deep clustering model named GW_DC to convert one-dimensional time-series into two-dimensional images and improve cluster performance for algorithm users. The proposed GW_DC consisted of three processing stages: the image conversion stage, image enhancement stage, and image clustering stage. In the image conversion stage, the time series were converted into four kinds of two-dimensional images by different algorithms, including grayscale images, recurrence plot images, Markov transition field images, and Gramian Angular Difference Field images; this last one was considered to be the best by comparison. In the image enhancement stage, the signal components of two-dimensional images were extracted and processed by wavelet transform to denoise and enhance texture features. Meanwhile, a deep clustering network, combining convolutional neural networks with K-Means, was designed for well-learning characteristics and clustering according to the aforementioned enhanced images. Finally, six UCR datasets were adopted to assess the performance of models. The results showed that the proposed GW_DC model provided better results.},

A partial list of such applications include (i) semantic analysis of documents used to cluster documents into areas of interest, (ii) collaborative filtering --- the reconstruction of missing data items, and (iii) determining the relative importance of documents based on citation/link structure. Intuitive arguments can explain some of the phenomena that has been observed but little theoretical study has been done. In this paper we present a model for framing data mining tasks and a unified approach to solving the resulting data mining problems using spectral analysis. These results give strong justification to the use of spectral techniques for latent semantic indexing, collaborative filtering, and web site ranking.},
