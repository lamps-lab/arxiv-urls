ABSTRACT
Online social media play a major role in shaping public discourse
and opinion, especially during political events. We present the first
public multi-platform dataset of Italian-language political conver-
sations, focused on the 2022 Italian general election taking place
on September 25th. Leveraging public APIs and a keyword-based
search, we collected millions of posts published by users, pages and
groups on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, along with metadata
of TikTok and YouTube videos shared on these platforms, over a pe-
riod of four months. We augmented the dataset with a collection of
political ads sponsored on Meta platforms, and a list of social media
handles associated with political representatives. Our data resource
will allow researchers and academics to further our understanding
of the role of social media in the democratic process.

INTRODUCTION
Online social media provide researchers and academics with un-
precedented opportunities to observe a wide range of political and
societal phenomena [21]. They also play a critical role in shaping
public opinion during political events [23], and represent a rich

source of data to study the interplay between political actors’ cam-
paigns [22], media outlets’ agenda settings [17], and users’ news
consumption [3].
In Italy, as of 20221, YouTube is the platform used by the largest
amount of internet users (88%), followed by Meta platforms (64%)
and TikTok (54%), whereas Twitter only accounts for approximately
7%2. However, previous studies of online social media during Italian
elections and referendum mostly focused on Twitter [21], due to
the large availability of data via its APIs. In this work, instead, we
present a public data resource of political conversations and user-
generated content shared around the 2022 Italian general election,
which allows researchers and academics to study multiple social
platforms simultaneously.
The 2022 Italian general election was the first ever to take place in
autumn, as a consequence of the fall of the government of national
unity led by Mario Draghi in July3. The election had a record-low
voter turnout and it was won by the right-wing coalition of Giorgia
Meloni with over 43% of the vote share. Among the opponents, the
Centre-left coalition led by Enrico Letta obtained approximately
25% of the voters, the populist Movimento 5 Stelle led by former PM
Giuseppe Conte reached less than 16%, and the liberal and centrist
Third Pole, which included former PM Matteo Renzi, obtained
almost 8% of the vote share.
We present ITA-ELECTION-2022, the first public multi-platform
dataset of Italian-language political conversations taking place on
online social media, with a focus on the 2022 Italian general election.
We collected millions of social media posts from Facebook, Insta-
gram and Twitter, as well as advertisements sponsored on Meta
platforms and metadata for TikTok and YouTube videos shared on
the aforementioned platforms. We finally augment the dataset with
a collection of social media handles associated with Italian political
representatives. To collect the data, we employed a snowball sam-
pling procedure and curated a list of relevant terms to accordingly
perform a keyword-based search during a period of four months
(July 2022 - October 2022). We provide public access to the data via
GitHub and DataVerse repositories, as detailed next.
Given the nature of multi-platform, our dataset offers a unique
opportunity for researchers to explore online political discourse
during election seasons. It is particularly beneficial for researchers
in those fields such as political science, sociology, digital ethics, and

RELATED WORK
There are several public datasets that allow to study social media
conversations around political issues. We focus our literature review
on the Italian context, and then describe a few datasets related to
other countries. We also refer the interested reader to [21] for an
overview of studies that describe the interplay between social media
and Italian politics.
[4] collect tweets in the Italian language continuously from 2012
to 2018, extracting a number of smaller datasets enriched with
different kinds of annotations for linguistic purposes. They provide
access to tweet IDs and annotations in a public repository.
[20] analyze the prevalence of Italian disinformation spreading
on Twitter in the five months preceding the 2019 European Parlia-
ment election. They collect over 300 k tweets sharing thousands
of news articles originating from websites flagged as unreliable by
journalists and fact-checkers, providing public access to tweet IDs
and lists of websites. The same authors provide a similar dataset
collected in a different period of 2019, and that contains tweets
sharing links to mainstream and traditional news websites, both in
the Italian and French language [19].
[12] study the polarization around the 2020 Italian constitutional
referendum. They collect a dataset of 1.2 M tweets discussing the
event – and provide access to their IDs –, with the goal of designing
a hashtag-based semi-automatic approach to label Twitter users’
stance towards the referendum.
Following the COVID-19 pandemic, several researchers collected
social media data to study conversations around the crisis, with
a particular focus on the impact of vaccine misinformation. [9]
study the evolution of Italian Twitter conversations around vaccines
during the period 2019-2021, whereas [13] collect tweets in multiple
languages (French, German and Italian) during the first year of
world vaccination programs. Both contributions give public access
to tweet IDs, with the latter providing also a set of labeled pro/anti-
vaccines tweets and hashtags that can be used for training machine
learning classifiers.
[6] provide a dataset of tweets discussing Brexit for a period of 45
months, from January 2016 until September 2019. The data, which
comprises 50.8 million tweets and 3.97 million users, is enriched
with metadata such as the bot score of users, sentiment score of
tweets, and political stance labels predicted by a classifier developed
by the authors.
There is a large number of datasets that focus on the U.S. elec-
tions (both presidential and midterms), and we provide here a non-
exhaustive list of available resources. [16] map candidates from
the 2010 U.S. Midterm election with their Twitter accounts and a
random sample of their followers. [5] collect over 171 M tweets
in the English language, mentioning Donald Trump and Hillary
Clinton during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. [10] and [24]
collect tweets discussing the 2018 U.S. Midterm election, both using
a hashtag-based search (e.g. tweets sharing the hashtag "#ivoted"
on election day) and querying Twitter APIs with general keywords
related to the midterm election. [7] provide a longitudinal dataset
of over 1.2 billion U.S. politics- and election-related tweets shared
around the period of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. Related
to the same election, [1] release a multi-modal dataset of 7.6 M
tweets and 25.6 M retweets from 2.6 M users related to voter fraud
claims. They augmented the data with cluster labels, users’ sus-
pension status, and perceptual hashes of tweeted images as well
as aggregate data from external links and YouTube videos shared
on Twitter. Lastly, [2] recently released a multi-platform dataset of
public social media posts related to the 2022 US Election, which is
very similar to the present resource.
Unlike most existing datasets that focused only on Twitter or
other individual platforms, our dataset covers a diverse set of social
media platforms. In addition, we provide access to political ads
placed on Meta plaforms as well as social media handles of political
representatives. Insofar, our resource enable researchers to gain
a more comprehensive understanding of social media discourse
during the Italian election.

DATA COLLECTION
This section describes the data collection procedure(s) carried out
to gather data from different social media platforms. We remark
that we employed the same list of keywords related to the Italian
election, which we obtained through a snowball sampling approach
using Twitter data only, to query different APIs. Our dataset con-
forms with FAIR principles: it is Findable, Accessible and Reusable as
it is publicly accessible in an online Github4 and DataVerse reposi-
tory5, where we provide the means to recreate it almost completely
(see limitations discussed next). It is also Interoperable as the data
files are released in “.csv" and “.txt" formats. We summarize some
statistics of the dataset in Table 1.
We remark that, at the time of this writing, it is unclear whether
Twitter APIs will be as easily accessible to researchers as they were
during the collection of this dataset, and this might affect future
usage of this resource. We encourage interested researchers in
reaching out to us in case they find difficulties in accessing Twitter
data.
3.1
Twitter
We collected all tweets in the Italian language related to the elec-
tion by using tweepy Python library to query Twitter v1.1 Filter
streaming API endpoint6 in the period September 2nd, 2022 - Octo-
ber 20th, 2022. We also leveraged Twitter historical Search API v2
endpoint7 to collect tweets retrospectively in the period July 1st,
2022 - September 1st, 2022. To query Twitter APIs we employed
a snowball sampling approach, following existing work [11, 13],
and generated a list of relevant keywords starting with seed terms
such as “elezioni2022" and “elezioni"(which means "elections" in

Italian); the final list contains 62 keywords and it is available in
the repository associated with this paper. A sample is provided in
Table 2. The total collection of tweets contains 19,087,594 tweets
shared by 618,089 unique users. We remark that to abide by Twit-
ter’s terms of service we only share tweet IDs publicly. These can
be “re-hydrated" to retrieve tweet objects, with the exception of
removed or protected tweets, by querying Twitter API directly or
using tools like Hydrator8 and twarc.9
3.2
Facebook and Instagram posts
We collected Facebook and Instagram data by employing Crowd-
Tangle, a public tool owned and operated by Meta [8] that allows
retrieving posts shared by public pages and groups with a cer-
tain amount of followers or that were manually added by other
researchers on the platform 10. We queried the /posts/search
endpoint11 using the same list of keywords employed for collecting
Twitter data. For each post, the API returns several attributes related
to the post and the page or group (to which we refer as “account"
in the following) that published it; the full list of attributes is avail-
able in the official documentation12. We retained only posts in the
Italian language by filtering on the languageCode parameter: the
final dataset contains 1,142,812 Facebook posts, shared by 445,461
unique pages and groups and generating over 233 M interactions
(shares, comments, reactions), and 68,078 Instagram posts, shared
by 5,274 unique pages and generating over 97 M interactions (likes

and comments). We provide access to the URLs and IDs of these
posts in the repository associated with this paper13.
3.3
TikTok and YouTube videos
We augmented our dataset of social media posts by extracting meta-
data for TikTok and YouTube videos shared in Facebook and Twitter
messages present in our dataset. It is worth mentioning that no such
links are shared in Instagram posts. For what concerns YouTube, we
identified all external links to the platform and employed the offi-
cial YouTube API14 to extract video information such as the author,
channel ID, video title, description, top 10 popular comments, etc.
The resulting collection yields metadata for 22,754 unique YouTube
videos shared on Twitter and 17,401 unique YouTube videos shared
on Facebook. For what concerns TikTok, given the lack of an offi-
cial API, we employed pyktok Python library15 to collect metadata
about TikTok videos such as the title, description, length as well as
information about the author of the video. The resulting collection
yields metadata for 1,903 unique TikTok videos shared on Twitter
and 1,744 unique TikTok videos shared on Facebook. We provide
full access to this metadata in the repository associated with the
paper.
3.4
Facebook and Instagram ads
We leveraged Meta Ad Library API16 to collect all ads about “social
issues, elections or politics" that were active on Meta platforms
(i.e., Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and the Audience Network)
during the period from July 1st, 2022 - October 20th, 2022. We
provide an example of a sponsored ad in Figure 1. We queried the
API with the same set of keywords mentioned beforehand; the API
allows to search ads using one keyword at a time, and we queried the
endpoint multiple times eventually discarding duplicated ads. The
resulting collection contains 29,211 unique ads paid by 3,750 unique
sponsors. For each ad, the API provides several different attributes:
date of creation, period when the ad is active, name of the sponsor,
message, platform on which the ad is active, lower and upper bound
for the amount spent and the number of impressions generated,
etc. Each of these attributes is detailed in the API documentation,
as referenced in the footnote above. In the repository associated

with this dataset we provide access to the ID of ads, which can
be then used to retrieve ads through Meta Ad Library interactive
search console or API. In particular, to abide by Meta’s terms of use,
an identification procedure is required to access the API endpoint,
whereas the interactive search console only requires a Meta account.
3.5
Social media handles of political
representatives
We compiled a list of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter handles
of elected members in the Senate and Chamber of deputies based
on the official list released by the Italian Ministry of Interior17.
Specifically, for each representative, we manually checked whether
their official account was present on the three platforms. In our
dataset, we matched over 450 Twitter accounts and Facebook pages,
and approximately 300 Instagram accounts. The full list is available
in the repository associated with this paper. We refer the interested
reader to a similar useful resource presented by [15], who provide
an online running database of politicians’ activity on social media
(currently only Twitter is supported) spanning multiple countries.

POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS
There are several potential applications for our dataset, which can
consider a single platform or multiple ones at the same time.
Interested researchers could further current understanding of
polarization processes taking place during election seasons by ana-
lyzing content shared on multiple social platforms at once. They
could study whether “echo-chamber" effects take place on different
platforms, highlighting similarities and differences in their forma-
tion process.
Other researchers might leverage the data in order to study how
political candidates interacted with potential voters on social media
platforms, thus analyzing in detail the political communication
strategies put in place by different candidates. They could also
investigate the presence of correlational effects between online
signals and electoral outcomes, or detect the presence of toxic
and hateful speech originating in specific communities of political
supporters.
Some researchers could investigate the presence of mis/disinformation
and astroturfing campaigns taking place in the run-up to the elec-
tion, studying patterns of similarities and differences among dif-
ferent platforms. They could also analyze how fringe and harmful
content spreads across communities present on different platforms,
and whether influential accounts play a role in amplifying certain
malicious narratives.

CONCLUSIONS
We released ITA-ELECTION-2022, a large-scale dataset of social
media posts in the Italian language discussing the 2022 Italian Gen-
eral election, which took place on 25th September 2022, spanning
multiple online platforms and covering a period of four months.
In addition to gathering posts shared on Twitter, Facebook and
Instagram, we collected ads sponsored on Meta platforms, we ex-
tracted metadata for YouTube and TikTok videos shared on different
platforms during the collection period, and we compiled a list of
17github.com/ondata/elezioni-politiche-2022
social media handles associated to political representatives that can
be used to gather further data. We described in detail the collec-
tion procedures carried out to build the dataset, and we suggested
potential directions for future research.
Our work is not without limitations. First, our keyword-based
search might entail results that are not completely accurate, e.g.,
one of the terms employed for the query is “conte", which might
refer both to former PM Giuseppe Conte and football manager
Antonio Conte. From another perspective, election-related terms
might have been employed for marketing campaigns and promot-
ing content that is not pertinent to the election. However, while
we are unable to address these issues, which would require non-
trivial efforts, researchers can further refine our data collection to
meet their needs. Moreover, we performed a backward search to
retrieve Twitter, Facebook and Instagram posts shared from July to
September 2022, and we missed those that were deleted or removed
during the same period. Similarly, by providing access only to IDs
and URLs of collected posts, posts that have been removed or made
private by users cannot be retrieved, thus limiting reproducibility
analyses. Furthermore, we did not filter out the activity of auto-
mated and inauthentic accounts that might have polluted organic
conversations around the election. Another limitation concerns
Meta which, as highlighted in [18], might not accurately label all
political ads as such and our collection might be missing some data.
Finally, the user base of different platforms analyzed in this work
might not be fully representative of the actual Italian population,
and this should be taken into consideration by future research.
Despite these limitations, we believe that our dataset provides
fertile ground for a number of intriguing and interesting research
applications. We hope that this resource can advance our under-
standing of the interplay between online social media and demo-
cratic processes.

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
We performed our data collection and public release in complete
agreement with the platforms’ terms of service. We acknowledge
that TikTok metadata was scraped from the platform, thus poten-
tially violating the platform’s terms of service, but this was due to
the lack of an official API [14]. We do not directly share the raw con-
tent of social media posts, but rather provide access to IDs and URLs
that can be used to retrieve the original data, with the exception of
posts that have been deleted by platforms, and removed or made
private by their author. We did not cause any harm to nor expose
information about individual users in the process of collecting and
releasing the data, with the only exception of political representa-
tives. We understand that disclosing their social media accounts
might open up to potential abuse by malicious actors, but at the
same time, it enables researchers, journalists and other stakeholders
to put important public actors, such as the members of the Italian
Parliament and Senate, to scrutiny in order to better understand
the influence of social media platforms on the democratic process.
Finally, we reckon that Twitter might limit access to its public APIs,
and we encourage interested researchers in contacting us may they
encounter difficulties in retrieving Twitter data.
