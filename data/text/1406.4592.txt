Abstract
Background. It is generally acknowledged that most complex diseases are aﬀected in
part by interactions between genes and genes and/or between genes and environmental fac-
tors. Taking into account environmental exposures and their interactions with genetic factors
in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can help to identify high-risk subgroups in the
population and provide a better understanding of the disease. For this reason, many methods
have been developed to detect gene-environment (G×E) interactions. Despite this, few loci
that interact with environmental exposures have been identiﬁed so far. Indeed, the modest
eﬀect of G×E interactions as well as confounding factors entail low statistical power to detect
such interactions.
Results.
In this work, we provide a simulated dataset in order to study methods for
detecting G×E interactions in GWAS in presence of confounding factor and population struc-
ture. Our work applies a recently introduced non-subjective method for H1 simulations called
waffect and exploits the publicly available HapMap project to build a datasets with real
genotypes and population structures. We use this dataset to study the impact of confounding
factors and compare the relative performance of popular methods such as PLINK, random
forests and linear mixed models to detect G×E interactions.
Conclusion. Presence of confounding factor is an obstacle to detect G×E interactions in
GWAS and the approaches considered in our power study all have insuﬃcient power to detect
the strong simulated interaction. Our simulated dataset could help to develop new methods
which account for confounding factors through latent exposures in order to improve power.

Introduction
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a standard method to identify common genetic fac-
tors that inﬂuence health and disease conditions. These methods have improved our understanding
of the genetic basis of many complex traits and are among the most used tools for analyzing com-
plex diseases. However, it is known that most complex diseases (e.g. diabetes, asthma and cancer)
are due to combined eﬀect of genes, environmental factors, as well as their interactions (Murcray
et al., 2009).
Over the last years, considerable eﬀorts have been put to detect gene-environment interactions
(G×E) in GWAS and few loci that interact with environmental exposures have been identiﬁed
(Rothman et al., 2010; Hamza et al., 2011; Garcia-Closas et al., 2010).
However, this problem is well known to be challenging due, in part, to the modest eﬀect
of such interactions in terms of relative risk. Another reason why detecting G×E interactions
is diﬃcult is population structure which can partially explain spurious associations (Astle and
Balding, 2009). Environmental confounding factors can also be an obstacle for detecting G×E
interactions. VanderWeele et al. have studied extensively the implications of confounding factors
in G×E interactions studies (VanderWeele et al., 2013, 2012). However, they were more concerned
about the rise of false positives in presence of environmental confounding than by the lose of power
to detect the causal loci. Indeed, if the environmental factor that interacts with a susceptibility
gene is unobserved but is correlated at some extent with one or several observed factors, not taking
it into account could decrease radically the power to detect the G×E interactions.
Nowadays, several methods are available to perform GWAS. In principle, they could be used
to detect G×E interactions. Among them, PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) can be considered as
a gold standard for classical analysis. A major concern in GWAS is the need to account for the
complicate dependence structure in the data, between loci as well as between individuals. Eﬀects of
population stratiﬁcation can be easily accounted in PLINK by adding the PCA’s ﬁrst components
as covariates.
As an alternative, linear mixed models stem as promising statistical methods to correct for the
stratiﬁcation in the population. A popular implementation of linear mixed models is Fast-LMM
(Lippert et al., 2011).
Furthermore, powerful data mining techniques are being increasingly used. Among them, the
application of random forests (RFs) to the discovery of SNPs related to human diseases has grown
in recent years (Goldstein et al., 2010).
Each time a new method is introduced, it is obviously essential to evaluate its performance in
comparison with existing techniques through power studies (Spencer et al., 2009). However, such
studies are often conducted by performing H1 simulations under models which are very similar
to the ones used to design the new method, thus giving it an obvious advantage over the other
methods. It is hence quite common to see many concurrent approaches each claiming to outperform
all others.
Recently, a new method for H1 simulations called waffect (pronounced ”double-u aﬀect” for
weighted aﬀectations) has been introduced to avoid this issue (Perduca et al., 2012).
Indeed,
this method does not make any other assumption than the causal disease model itself, whose
choice is completely unconstrained. waffect uses weighted permutations to generate phenotypes
conditionally to the genotypes and covariates by taking into account both the causal disease model
and the design of the study. With this new approach, it is hence possible to produce non-subjective
H1 datasets which do not favor one analysis method over the others.
The aim of this paper is twofold: 1- To propose an useful simulated dataset based on real
genotypes with a confounding factor that interacts with the causal locus and is correlated with
the observed covariates. For this purpose, we exploited the publicly available HapMap project
datasets (Thorisson et al., 2005) to obtain real genotypes with population structures, and we used
waffect to generate phenotypes for a chosen causal disease model. This simulated dataset could be
very useful for future works aiming at studying the many issues involved in the detection of G×E
interactions in GWAS. 2- To study the eﬀect of a confounding factor on the power to detect G×E
interactions in GWAS. For this purpose, we compared four approaches based on three popular
2

methods (PLINK, Fast-LMM and random forests) by performing power analysis on our simulated
dataset.

Simulated Dataset
2.1
Genotypes
The genotypic dataset used in our study was extracted from the HapMap phase III database of ge-
netic variations (Gibbs et al., 2003). This database investigates 11 human populations including 57
unrelated MEX, 146 unrelated YRI, 52 unrelated ASW, 110 unrelated CEU, 154 unrelated MKK,
137 unrelated CHB, 109 unrelated CHD, 101 unrelated GIH, 113 unrelated JPT, 110 unrelated
LWK and 102 unrelated TSI. Only the SNPs that are shared by all populations were retained.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the whole genome, keeping one SNP over
1000 SNPs; the ﬁrst ﬁve principal components (pca i, i = 1, . . . , 5) were considered as covariates.
Figure 1 shows that the PCs allow to retrieve easily the information about the population.
The association analysis in our study were conducted on Chromosome 6, after quality control
including Hardy Weinberg equilibrium testing and exclusion of SNPs with a minor allele frequency
(MAF) less than 5%.
2.2
Covariates
Covariates and phenotypes were simulated in order to mimic a complex interaction between an arbi-
trarily chosen causal SNP and a confounding factor through a latent exposure (called treatment).
The latent exposure was deﬁned with high correlation with two observed covariates (bmi, for body
mass index, and sex) as well as with the population of belonging. The idea is that the treatment
is typically taken by women (and less often by men) trying to loose weight.
bmi was simulated taken into account the ﬁve ﬁrst principal components and another environ-
mental covariate denoted smoking. This binary variable was simulated to mimic smoking behaviors
with a probability distribution which depends on the population and sex. Indeed, women usually
smoke less than men with this diﬀerence depending on the population. In order to simulate the
smoking covariate, the eleven populations were classiﬁed in three sub-populations: European (E);
African (Af) and Asian (As).
In the European sub-population, we considered that 32% of individuals were smokers. More
speciﬁcally, we supposed that 37% of men and 27% of women were smokers. In the African sub-
population, the prevalence of smoking was supposed to be 27%: 43.8% among men and 12.9%
among women (Christopoulou and Lillard, 2011). At last, in the Asian sub-population, we con-
sidered that 27% of individuals were smokers: 45.7% among men and 4.8 % among women (Tsai
et al., 2008). Covariate sex was obtained from HapMap data.
Speciﬁcally, bmi was simulated with a regression on the ﬁrst ﬁve principal components in order
to have 60% of heritability and with a residual standard deviation of 4.0. To take into account
the fact that in average smokers have a lower bmi than non-smokers, we simulated a smoker eﬀect
in the bmi covariate by adding a score of 1.5 to the bmi average for non-smokers (Chiolero et al.,
2008).
The individual probability to take a treatment, P(treatment), was correlated with covariates
bmi, sex and the population of belonging as follows:
1/P(treatment) = (1 + 2 × 1sex=1) × [1 + exp(−bmi + 25 + γ)]
where γ ∈{−inf, −0.1, 0, 0.15, −0.45, 0.35, 0.6, −0.4, 0.05, 0.1} for population 1 to 11.
To sum up, in our standard design covariates sex, pca i, (i = 1, . . . , 5), bmi and smoking were
supposed observed. The population of belonging, covariate treatment and the other principal
components were supposed unknown (even though these are easily computable).

2.3
Disease Model
We arbitrarily chose the SNP in position 22,683,075 in a dense area of chromosome 6, as the binary
susceptibility locus, denoted causalSNP. Assuming a dominant eﬀect, we encoded causalSNP = 1
in presence of at least one minor frequency allele and causalSNP = 0 otherwise. We considered a
disease model with a very strong G×E interaction (relative risk of 50) with a baseline prevalence
of 1%:
P(disease) = 0.01 × (1.0 + 50.0 × 1causalSNP=1 × 1treatment=1)
It is important to stress that this is not a very realistic model of complex disease due to the
lack of genetic marginal eﬀects and also due to the very strong interaction with a relative risk
(RR) equal to 50. We chose not to include any marginal eﬀects for sake of clarity and because we
were interested on the detection of G×E interactions. Concerning the strong G×E interaction, we
chose to have a relative risk as 50 in order to increase the chance of detecting the G×E interaction
in presence of the simulated confounding factor.
Phenotypes were simulated accordingly to the disease models by means of the package waffect
(Perduca et al., 2012) publicly available on the CRAN server of R packages (R Core Team, 2013).
This enabled us to simulate exactly 595 cases and 596 controls for the 1191 individuals from the
HapMap genotypic dataset (see next session for a comprehensive introduction to waffect ).

Power analysis
3.1
Phenotype Simulations
In order to assess the empirical statistical power of diﬀerent tools to detect associations, we simu-
lated 200 phenotypes replicates under the disease model H1 and 200 phenotypes replicates under
the null hypothesis H0 of no association. Each replicate consists of 1191 phenotypes, one for each
individual.
The simulations under H0 were obtained by simply permuting the phenotypes, thus breaking
potential associations between phenotypes and genotypes. The simulations under the alternative
hypothesis H1 were performed using the R package waffect publicly available on CRAN (Perduca
et al., 2012).
The principal function in waffect is based on a backward sampling algorithm which makes it
possible to generate weighted permutations. For the purposes of phenotype simulation, the vector
of weights is given by the penetrance, that is the probability for each individual to be a case
according to the disease model. One crucial consequence of using weighted permutations is that
the number of cases and controls is constant across the replicates. This makes it possible to respect
the original design in each replicate and therefore to compare the performance of an association
method across diﬀerent replicates.
Simulating phenotypes rather than genotypes, as does the gold standard Hapgen (Su et al.,
2011), does not require additional data such as haplotype frequencies or recombination rates and
has the obvious advantages of requiring much smaller computational memory and time. Moreover,
for the purposes of the present work, the primary beneﬁt of using waffect is that it only requires a
vector of probabilities as input. As a result, the choice of the disease model is totally unconstrained;
in particular it is possible to include G×E interactions.
In principle, one could achieve the same result by simply using a rejection algorithm which
samples the phenotype of each individual according to the probability to be a case and then
accepts the resulting replicate only if there are enough cases. Because the probability of obtaining
a full conﬁguration of phenotypes with the correct number of cases is extremely low, this approach
cannot be used in practice. In order to overcome this problem, a solution often applied in practice is
to increase the prevalence in the disease model, maintaining unchanged the relative risks. However
it can be proved that adjusting the prevalence creates bias in the empirical power estimate (Perduca
et al., 2012).

3.2
Statistical analysis
In this section, we brieﬂy describe the four popular approaches adopted in our study to perform
GWA analysis. The goal standard PLINK (individual SNP logistic regression, Purcell et al., 2007)
was applied in two alternative approaches : 1- analysis performed regardless of G×E interactions
and considering only genetic eﬀects; and, since it is easy to consider interaction terms with PLINK,
2- analysis performed taking into account G×E interactions. The other two approaches are 3- the
linear mixed model for population structure correction implemented in Fast-LMM (Lippert et al.,
2011), and 4- the random forest data mining technique (RandomForest R package, Liaw and
Wiener, 2002).
3.2.1
PLINK
PLINK implements a logistic regression approach (Purcell et al., 2007) that allows for multiple
binary or continuous covariates when testing for disease trait SNP association and interactions
with covariates. PLINK provides p-values for signiﬁcance coeﬃcients in the logistic model. In this
work, we considered two approaches using PLINK.
The ﬁrst approach, which we referred to as ”PLINK SNP”, consisted in performing analysis
regardless of G×E interactions by looking at the p-value associated to the signiﬁcant coeﬃcients
for the SNPs.
We referred to the second approach as ”PLINK SNP×COV”, where COV is the environmental
covariate under consideration (either bmi in our standard design or treatment in our further
analysis, see below). PLINK SNP×COV accounted for all the interactions between the analyzed
SNPs and the environmental factor considered through the p-values associated to the signiﬁcance
coeﬃcients of such interactions.
Correction for population structure was taken into account by considering the ﬁve ﬁrst principal
components resulting from the PCA performed on the whole genome.
3.2.2
Random Forests
Random forests (RFs) have been introduced by Breiman (2001). The general principle consists in
building repeatedly classiﬁcation and regression trees (CART) from bootstrapping of the original
data.
This process produces a forest of classiﬁcation trees which are statistically analyzed to
produce importance measures of the covariates (e.g. a variable belonging to many trees probably
plays a key role in the classiﬁcation).
Random forests are a popular way to perform data mining on GWAS data. Despite the fact
that they exploit heavily marginal linear regressions, random forests are able to detect interactions
between variables (see Boulesteix et al., 2012, for an overview of random forests in the GWAS
context). Recently, a regularized version of random forests has been proposed to deal with high
dimensional data (Deng and Runger, 2012). In this work we decided to disregard this approach
because it was too slow on our data to be practical.
For our random forests analysis, we used the randomForest package (version 4.6-7) from R (R
Core Team, 2013). We simply used the default parameters of the method with the disease status
as a binary outcome and with all observed covariates and SNPs as explanatory variables. Once the
forest computed, we extracted for each variable its importance measure using the default approach
of the package (normalized diﬀerence between out-of-bag proportion error using original data or
a permuted version). We hence obtained for each variable and each replicate a real value which
reﬂects the importance of the variable for discriminating between cases and controls. The higher
this importance value, the stronger the association with the disease.
3.2.3
Fast-LMM
It is a well known problem that in GWAS confounding eﬀects of population structure lead to false
positive and therefore need to be taken into account. An alternative to including the ﬁrst principal
components in linear or logistic regression models in order to correct for confounding factors are
Linear Mixed Models (LMMs, Hoﬀman, 2013). LMMs generalize linear models by introducing
5

random eﬀects as predictors, in addition to the usual ﬁxed eﬀects. Indeed, LMMs are known to
be eﬀective when observations are not independent but rather involve related individuals.
In LMMs for GWAS, the random eﬀect is expressed by a multivariate normal distribution
whose variance-covariance matrix measures the genetic similarity between individuals. Recently
the algorithm Fast-LMM has been introduced to perform eﬃciently exact inference for LMMs
(Lippert et al., 2011). Roughly speaking, Fast-LMM (for Factored spectrally transformed Linear
Mixed Models) is based on a spectral decomposition of the genetic similarity matrix which rotates
the phenotypes into uncorrelated phenotypes thus converting the original estimation problem into
the maximization of the likelihood of a linear regression model.
A drawback of the current implementation of Fast-LMM is that it does not allow to consider
explicit interaction terms between genotypic variables and covariates in the linear mixed model 1.
A possible solution to overcome this limitation is to code directly such interactions in the covariate
ﬁle, thus adding new columns. However, this solution was not appropriate in this context because
it would have required to magnify several times the size of the variables ﬁle in order to consider the
cartesian product of all the SNPs with all the covariates. We then we simply applied Fast-LMM
to the original genotypic and covariate datasets.
3.3
Power, ROC curves and AUC
In order to evaluate empirically the performance of the methods described above, we computed
four summary statistics, one for each method. These global statistics were then used to estimate
the Area under the Curve (AUC) corresponding to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves of the four methods, each expressing the performance of the corresponding method.
More speciﬁcally, for PLINK SNP we took as simple global statistics the smallest among all the
p-values associated to the signiﬁcance coeﬃcients of the SNPs, similarly for Fast-LMM. For PLINK
SNP×COV, we took the smallest among all the p-values associated to signiﬁcance coeﬃcients of
the terms coding for the interactions between the SNPs and the covariate (bmi or treatment). At
last, the summary statistics for the random forest-based method was deﬁned as the maximum of
the importance statistics over all considered SNPs.
Then, for each method, we obtained two vectors of length 200, one under H0 and one under
H1. These two vectors of comprehensive signals were used to estimate the ROC curves of the four
methods using the R package pROC (Robin et al., 2011).
We recall that ROC curves provide a graphical representation of the speciﬁcities and sensitivities
(i.e. values of statistical power) that can be obtained for all possible values of the threshold of
signiﬁcance (Metz, 1978). An informative summary of the ROC curve information is the area under
the ROC curve (i.e. AUC). The AUC can be qualitatively interpreted as follows: AUC ≤0.6 means
‘fail’; 0.6 < AUC ≤0.70 means ‘poor’; 0.7 < AUC ≤0.80 means ‘fair’; 0.8 < AUC ≤0.9 means
‘good’; 0.9 < AUC ≤1.0 means ‘excellent’.

Results and discussion
Association analysis were adjusted on covariates sex, smoking together with either bmi (our stan-
dard design) or treatment.
Moreover, for PLINK and random forests the ﬁve ﬁrst principal
components pci, i ∈{1, . . . , 5} were included as predictors. We recall that in order to evaluate
empirically the detection power of the four approaches in presence of confounding factor, analysis
were performed on 200+200 phenotypic replicates under H0 and H1. Investigations were performed
on chromosome 6 and subregions.
4.1
Confounding factor is not known
At ﬁrst, the latent exposure treatment (i.e.
the confounding factor) was supposed to be un-
known : the covariate bmi was observed instead of treatment and considered, mistakenly, as the
environmental exposure of interest.
1(We unsuccessfully tried to contact the authors of Fast-LMM on this matter.)
6

Table 1 shows the estimated AUC together with 95% conﬁdence intervals for the four ap-
proaches. Obviously, the performance of each method increases when the region under considera-
tion decreases and reach a good power when the region is restricted to the causal SNP. However
power is low (fail or poor) when estimation are done on whole chromosome 6. PLINK SNP, Fast-
LMM and RF provide comparable results even if PLINK SNP seems to be a little more eﬃcient.
Surprisingly, the estimated performance is better with PLINK SNP than with PLINK SNP×bmi.
For example, applying PLINK SNP on a region with less than 800 SNPs around the causal SNP
provides good to excellent power while analysis with PLINK SNP×bmi need to be restricted to the
causal SNP to reach similar power. At ﬁrst, this counter-intuitive result led us to believe that it
is unnecessary to account for the G×E interactions in analysis since PLINK SNP provides better
power than PLINK SNP×bmi.
Furthermore, we note that AUC estimate applying PLINK SNP×bmi when the analysis is
performed on the whole chromosome 6 appears higher than on a region of 4000 SNPs around the
causal SNP. This result could be explained by sample variability.
4.2
Confounding factor is known
To try to understand the fact that taking into account G×E interactions in presence of a confound-
ing factor seems not to improve the performance, we performed association analysis by replacing
the covariate bmi by the confounding factor treatment. This is possible because analysis are done
on our simulated dataset for which we know the covariate treatment.
Table 2 shows the results obtained observing the confounding factor. In this context, AUC
estimated with PLINK SNP×treatment are equal to 1, as expected given the strength of the
simulated G×E interaction. This results show that the approach accounting for the interaction is
better than approach accounting only for the SNP and demonstrate the importance of accounting
for G×E interaction in a process of consideration of a confounding factor.
In contrast, the AUC estimated with PLINK SNP are almost equal to the AUC estimated
when the confounding factor treatment is latent and instead the covariate bmi is observed. As
expected, Fast-LMM gives similar results to PLINK SNP. For the RF, we can only observe a slight
improvement (1 to 3% of AUC). This is due to the fact that, like for Fast-LMM or PLINK SNP,
the RF approach does not consider explicitly interactions with the covariates. However, RF are
known to be able to capture complex non-linear interaction between covariates which tend to be
co-selected in the same trees. In our example, this alleged feature clearly shows its limits.
4.3
Further considerations
An interesting property of Fast-LMM is it accounts for population structure by introducing random
eﬀects as predictors. In this context, analysis were performed with Fast-LMM, with no principal
components as covariates. We veriﬁed (results not shown) that accounting explicitly for principal
components gives similar results. In the same way, we performed analysis with PLINK SNP×bmi
considering explicitly the population of belonging instead of principal components and found similar
results than considering principal components (results not shown).
Another question that may arise is about the signal localization. Indeed, presence of confound-
ing factor makes very diﬃcult to identify the causal SNP. Figure 2 shows the Manhattan plots
obtained performing PLINK SNP×COV analysis on Chromosome 6 from one simulation under
H1. The vertical red line indicates the causal SNP location. On ﬁgure 2(a) analysis was performed
observing the confounding factor treatment (i.e. using PLINK SNP×treatment approach) and
on ﬁgure
2(b) analysis was performed in presence of confounding factor.
(i.e.
using PLINK
SNP×bmi approach). When the confounding factor is known, the location detected by the signal
is the same as the causal SNP location. In contrast, in presence of confounding factor, there is no
signal clearly detected.

Conclusion
This article presents a simulated dataset - based on the HapMap project data with real genotypes
and population structures - which can be helpful in studying the impact of a confounding factor
on the detection of G×E interactions in GWAS. Furthermore, the proposed dataset was used to
conduct a non-subjective power analysis using three popular GWAS statistical methods (PLINK,
Random Forests and Fast-LMM) and four corresponding summary statistics. The non-subjectivity
comes from the fact that the phenotypes under H1 as well as under H0 were simulated with waffect
which does not require any additional information other than the original genotypes. The dataset
will be made available on ENA at the time of publication, so that all replication will be feasible.
The disease model was built with a strong interaction between the causal SNP (which was
chosen arbitrarily) and an unobserved environmental exposure to a treatment and no main eﬀect
given by the causal SNP or the latent exposure. Obviously, the high relative risk resulting from the
considered G×E interaction and the absence of a marginal SNP eﬀect are unrealistic. However, the
confounding factor causes such a loss of detection power that it is necessary to study such typical
case in ﬁrst place. Indeed, analysis performed on the whole chromosome 6 shows a poor signal
detection power for the four approaches considered in presence of confounding factor. Furthermore,
we show that when analysis is performed regardless the interaction, the fact to observe or not the
confounding factor treatment has no impact on the detection power. These results highlight the
importance of taking into account the G×E interactions at the risk of ﬁnding no signal at all.
In this work, we chose to focus on three popular methods belonging to diﬀerent families of
statistical techniques. Unfortunately, the current implementation of Fast-LMM does not allow
to account for G×E interactions.
The proposed dataset has the potential to provide a good
framework to develop further features of Fast-LMM enabling it to account for such interactions.
As an alternative, we considered the idea to precompute a full covariate matrix including interaction
to Fast-LMM, but this approach was ﬁnally discarded since there was no way to force fast-LMM
to perform the appropriate signiﬁcance tests. Similar consideration hold for the RF which are not
speciﬁcally designed to deal with explicit interactions.
Other methods based on the linear model are known for case control data, in order to detect
G×E interactions. Kraft and al. (Kraft et al., 2007) proposed a powerful 2-df joint test of marginal
association and G×E interaction. Shortly after, Mucray and al. (Murcray et al., 2009) proposed
a 2-step approach for detecting G×E interaction in GWA studies. Dai and al.(Dai et al., 2012)
proposed a new way to combine the test of marginal genetic eﬀect and the test of G×E interaction,
by exploiting the independence between the two tests. While these methods have demonstrated
their eﬃciency, their performance was assessed through simulations that do not account for realistic
complexity such as the inclusion of confounding factor and/or of complicated dependance structures
between individuals as well as between loci. Testing the detection power of these tests on our
realistic simulated dataset could then be an interesting development.
Results obtained in this
paper already seem to show that methods based on the linear model have poor power.
As a
consequence, we can expect that the tests mentioned above will not perform well either.
In conclusion, eﬀorts should be put in developing methods able to take into account confounding
factors such as a potential latent exposure.
